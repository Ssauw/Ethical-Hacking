# Ethical-Hacking
Everything that I learn will be put in here. I'll try to maintain this blog as much as possible !
PS: Don't be mad at me if I make any English mistakes, I'm French. D:

# Who Am I ?

My name is Laurent Loux and I'm a 19 years old French IT student. I have a DUT Informatique (Bac+2) and I'm currently doing my master I (Bac+4) in software engineering manager in apprenticeship to finally do my Master II (Bac+5) in IT Security also in apprenticeship. I've always been passionated by computer stuff and how these things work. I've started to be interested in security and Hacking at the age around 13 years old. Sadly, I quickly stopped to learn due to my lack of knowledge in computer science and my eager to become better on video games...Hopefully today, I'm more than ever passionated about security and computer science in general and I want to learn more and more every day. I aim to become a great Ethical Hacker, a pentester or security expert.

# Why this "blog" ?

I simply know many people who does that and it's a pretty common thing to do when it comes to security area. But I'm not doing it just because of that (I promise I'm not a sheep :P), I'm doing it because I feel like having to do it. I just realize this is something like a step for me to achieve my dream to become an Ethical Hacker. And to be honest with you, It's the first time I'm doing this kind of thing like writting stuff that crosses my mind.. and it feels terribly good ! So this blog will allow me to write about security topics, CTF Walkthrough or even new exploits I just learned about. This is a good way for me to test my knowledge because If you truly understand something therefore you can teach it. 

# Special Thanks

I'd like to sincerely thank Julien Garnier with whom I'd never be who I am today. He's a passionate and really nice person and not to mention a really great Hacker. He's the only one who took care of me and showed me the road to Hacking. He's my professor and mentor in security and I have many things to learn from him.

I'd also like to thank my girlfriend who made me realize how much I was wasting my time on video games and so made me more assiduous on my work. That was the real trigger for me to grow up about work.
