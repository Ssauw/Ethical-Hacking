# Ethical-Hacking
Everything that I learn will be put in here. I'll try to maintain this blog as much as possible !
PS: Don't be mad at me if I make any English mistakes, I'm French. D:

# Who Am I ?

My name is Laurent Loux and I'm a 19 years old French IT student. I have a DUT Informatique (Bac+2) and I'm currently doing my master I (Bac+4) in software engineering manager in apprenticeship to finally do my Master II (Bac+5) in IT Security also in apprenticeship. I've always been passionated by computer stuff and how these things work. I've started to be interested in security and Hacking at the age around 13 years old. Sadly, I quickly stopped to learn due to my lack of knowledge in computer science and my eager to become better on video games...Hopefully today, I'm more than ever passionated about security and computer science in general and I want to learn more and more every day. I aim to become a great Ethical Hacker, a pentester or security expert.

# Why this "blog" ?

I simply know many people who does that and it's a pretty common thing to do when it comes to security area. But I'm not doing it just because of that (I promise I'm not a sheep :P), I'm doing it because I feel like having to do it. I just realize this is something like a step for me to achieve my dream to become an Ethical Hacker. And to be honest with you, It's the first time I'm doing this kind of thing like writting stuff that crosses my mind.. and it feels terribly good !
